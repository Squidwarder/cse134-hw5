# cse134-hw5
CSE 134 HW 5 Repo. Contains the HTML structure from HW2 (slightly modified) and relevant CSS files to stylize the webpages (from HW3). Also includes JavaScript code from HW4 as well as Light/Dark theme switching function.
> Note some of the CSS functionalities doesn't work on all browsers, so viewing experience could vary greatly. These newer features were implemented because of HW requirements.

Regarding images, I'm using WebP format in the websites. And the favicons are larger than anticapted but from what I understand all of these are required to ensure that the favicon is correctly displayed across platforms (a simple favicon.ico isn't enough anymore).
