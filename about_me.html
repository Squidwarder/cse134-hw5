                <h2>Hobbies</h2>
                I really enjoy watching motorsport (F1, MotoGP, WRC) in my free time.
                I just really like cars and the sensation of driving them (I highly recommend people to try
                out go-karts.) I used to play a lot of simulation driving games like Assetto Corsa, but after coming
                to college the equipments (game steering wheel and pedal) became too cumbersome so I dropped that.
